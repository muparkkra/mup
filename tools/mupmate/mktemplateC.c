/* This creates a template.C file that declares a string containing
 * the text of template.mup, that can them be compiled into Mupmate.
 * Building the template into Mupmate means
 * the template file does not have to exist at run time, and we don't
 * have to look for it. We used to do this with an "ed" script, but
 * now have this C program to try to be more portable.
 * It reads in the LICENSE (given as first argument), and outputs it
 * inside a comment. Then it prints an explanatory comment and declares
 * the string. Then it reads the template.mup file (second argument) and
 * outputs it with proper quoting: backslashes before backslashes and double
 * quote, and backslashed newlines at the end of each line.
 * It finishes off with the final double quote and semicolon.
