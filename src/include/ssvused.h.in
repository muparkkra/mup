/*
 * This file contains the array subscript definitions for the used[] array
 * of an SSV struct. An SSV contains parameters associated with a
 * Score, Staff, or Voice.  The used[] array is a set of flags which say
 * whether a given parameter is actually populated in the SSV instance.
 * In the "score" SSV, all used flags are always set true.  In SSVs for
 * a staff or voice, a "used" flag is only set to true if the user
 * specified a value for the parameter in that staff or voice context.
 *
 * The actual values are machine-generated so they get automatically
 * renumbered if parameters are added or deleted or rearranged.
 *
 * We try to put things that are logically similar close together in
 * this list, but they could be in any order, other than that NUMFLDS
 * _must_ be last.
