The Mup Music Publication program
</H1>
<P>
Mup is a free, yet very feature rich, music publication program.
<A HREF="obtain.html">Mup Version 7.0 is now available</A>
in source form as well as ready-to-run for Windows, Mac OS X,
and Linux x86_64.
</P>
<P>
Music is described by a text file that you can create
using your favorite editor or the included Mupmate program.
Mup then determines how to lay out the music,
and generates PostScript output for displaying or printing it.
It is a powerful and flexible program, which has been used on many thousands of
songs in a wide variety of styles, both instrumental and vocal.
