This review was published in the May 1998 issue of
Linux Gazette.
It was also published in paper form in the September 1998 issue of
Linux Journal.
A survey of Mup users was conducted by a Mup user in 2007 and the

Mup is a marvelous tool.
It fits me and the way I work, and it has allowed me to build
arrangements, small, large and HUGE that I would not have been able to
do without it.
I am always amused when someone brings in a piece of music that they've
tried to do in Finale or Sibelius.  They can't figure out how to make it
work because it's so complicated! And the printed music is
<STRONG>nowhere near</STRONG> the quality that Mup produces.

Let me first thank you for making Mup available for evaluation
as you do; it's much better to actually use a product than to make a     
decision based on slick advertising brochures.  Overall, I am astounded at
the functionality of Mup, and its fantastic output.  It is obviously much 
better than Finale, which I have used in the past.
I tried returning to Finale yesterday, but having seen Mup,
it was just too painful.

I'd like to take a moment and congratulate you on an extremely useful
piece of software. Mup offers a very small learning curve, is accompanied by
excellent documentation, and is quick and easy to enter the needed data.
The visual output is also incredible.
The ability to define and use custom guitar chord grids is a wonderful
&quot;perk&quot;, as is the ability to transpose and print selected
staves for parts. The ability to dump to MIDI output is probably the
nicest feature - it's a lot easier to find those typos when you can hear
it played back. For me, the MIDI output feature is an indispensible tool.
Many thanks!

I've been in the software world for almost 60 years, and the
combination of low bug rate, high quality output / functionality, and
responsiveness to bugs and feature requests that you continue to bring
to mup is head and shoulders above any other piece of software that I
can remember using, including a lot of the software that underlies the
Internet. It is really extraordinary. Computer science schools
should use mup, and whatever your process is for managing its
evolution, as a case study!

I have been a Finale user for a long time, but I'm switching to Mup.
I love the fact that I can edit my music on my Palm Pilot - and it only
took me about a day to learn the language well enough to be able to
enter my compositions. So - thank you for a very well-designed product.

New Mup user here.
I have played with it I find it to be extremely cool.
I have attempted lilypond several times and always ran
into roadblocks requiring mind-twisting work arounds.
Mup seems MUCH more straightforward.  Also, though lily is supposed
to look great on paper (I wouldn't know since I have never
really been able to complete a score with it),
I find that whatever lily outputs looks positively HORRIBLE in PDF form
on screen, but MUP looks great on both page and screen....so
the MUP guys are doing something right there!

Just a note to say thanks for Mup! It is really a great piece of work.
For the last two years I have been trying to learn how to use Lilypond.
I never have been able to get the results that I was looking for.
When I came across Mup a couple of weeks ago,
it was so easy I turned out my first hymn in two days,
and three more by the end of the week. Best of all I was
able to get all the results I have been looking for!
I wished I would have found it two years ago.
It would have saved me two years of frustration!
Keep up the good work. Your software is first class!

Thanks for the great program! It would have taken several more years
to save up for any other program that has the capacity to generate
this quality of music.
I use it all the time for my
personal enjoyment, and agree that it is the best program for writing
music, ever!

I wanted to express my enthusiasm about your program. It's amazing how one
can start out typesetting one's own music after only five or ten minutes
of reading into the documentation. I had tried musixtex before and hadn't
expected to find something that makes things so much simpler.

I was previously using a demo version
of Sibelius but I had no idea how I was going to come up with the $600.
Many issues of lay-out which Mup handles for me have to be
done manually with Sibelius, and it takes longer to write a chart.
Thank you again.
I'm telling folks in my Barbershop chapter to go for Mup.

I'm the original author of
<A HREF="http://www.ghostscript.com/">Ghostscript</A>,
which (as I discovered) Mup uses for
printing. I'm also a musician and composer. In August (2000), when I was
looking for a good notation program for Linux, I checked out the 6
notation programs at the Shareware Music Machine site, and Mup looked like
the only one that really delivered the goods. Now that I've found the time
to start using it seriously, I'm extremely pleased with the result.  It
does just what the (clear and straightforward) documentation says it does,
and does it well. Thank you!

Congratulations on a wonderful program. I needed to print out some music
at very short notice: I managed to download and learn Mup
very quickly and had the score ready (2-voice treble + bass and 2-verse
lyrics) in about an hour. I've previously used Rosegarden and MusicTeX,
neither of which is as easy to use. The &quot;proof-listening&quot; MIDI output
feature is fantastic.

I LOVE Mup!!!
For amateurs with even a little
computer literacy, you can't beat it.  Most free software packages are lame, 
difficult to use, or have poor quality output.  But not Mup.  You guys did a
great job with it!

A compliment to the quality of Mup output: I took a

&quot;I definitely want a copy of this piece: who publishes it?&quot;

Thanks for an excellent product!  I used it on my senior honors project,
and it was great.  Entering the music was very fast.
The Mup-generated PostScript was beautiful and professional
looking.  My professors and other students (most of whom use Finale or
Encore, one prof uses Sibelius) were amazed at how good it looks.

I'm *very* impressed with the program.
Thank you very much for making this program available -- I intended
to wrestle with MusicTex, but I'd heard that it was difficult and
was putting it off. Mup is delightfully logical, and easy to learn,
and the output is easy to incorporate into Tex output like any
other graphics. I'm particularly impressed with the balance between
computer assistance (in checking each bar against the time signature,
for instance) and user intervention (for instance, in matters of
`beaming').  It is very nice to deal with a program
where the purpose and the execution are so well matched.

I just spent part of the weekend reading your documentation (generally

Thanks for writing such a simple, yet powerful program.
I've already wasted time and money trying other transcription software

to try it. I'm satisfied!

Thank you very much for your help. And, please, be proud of your software:
I experimented a lot with Finale at school: it's a nice program indeed but
it is not so easy (and often tricky) to get a professional result.
I decided to acquire Mup half an hour after I started to use it:
it took twenty (!) minutes to get where I arrived with Finale after a month.

Mup is a dream come true for me. After downloading several point-and-click

I downloaded Mup and built for Linux and there were no problems.
Within an hour I had finished my first score, about the length
of time it would have taken to ink it with no mistakes.
The results were very nice, and you saved me the $350 that I
was prepared to shell out for Finale.

I am quite favorably impressed with Mup. I learned Finale for Macintosh when
I was in college, and Mup beats it hands down for speed and ease of use.
Keep up the good work!

With Finale, it took me
approximately two months to get to the point where I produced
finished-looking music output.  I got to that point with Mup in about
20 minutes, and the quality was comparable to an investment of
significantly more time in Finale.  I especially liked the way that
dynamics, crescendo markings, ties, and slurs are placed in what I
consider intelligent and appropriate places by default, but that there
is also some more control available.  I also like very much the
TeX-like ASCII input method, since it's a great deal less
processor-intensive than the Finale point-and-click interface.  

Once again, thanks. I've recommended Mup
to several of my friends and colleagues who
admired my printed-out work.

I have tried and used both GUI and text based systems 
and am very impressed, not only with the thought that has gone into MUP,
but with the ease of accomplishing the gamet of musical notation.

I am currently doing some arrangements for my daughter's 
upcoming wedding.  The speed of input and quality of output is amazing. 
Thank you very much for a superior product.

One last thing. I have always been impressed at how Mup does its job,

I have to say that Mup seems to be a
promising alternative to today's slow and clumsy WYSIWYG notation programs.

I am mostly interested in notation for practical everyday use and in my
first quick tries with Mup I especially liked the idea of just entering
the music and getting a reasonable layout, without much fiddling and fine
tuning by hand.

Your automatic formatter runs rings around anything that I've been able to

With Mup, once it's in, almost no additional work is needed to get good
output.
