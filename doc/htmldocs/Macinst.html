<H1>Mup 7.1 for Mac OS X</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
<I>Mup</I> is a music publication program by
<A HREF="http://www.arkkra.com">Arkkra Enterprises.</A>
Music is described by a text file that you can create using
your favorite editor or the included <i>Mupmate</i> program.
<I>Mup</I> then determines how to lay out the music,
and generates PostScript output for displaying or printing it,
or a MIDI file for playing it.
</P>
<P>
See the included documents
<A HREF="overview.html">overview.html</A>,
<A HREF="mupfeat.html">mupfeat.html</A>,
and the <A HREF="http://www.arkkra.com">Arkkra website</A> for details.
</P>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<P>
The prebuilt version <I>Mup</I> available from Arkkra Enterprises
has been built for x86_64. It can be compiled for other architectures,
and should work back to at least OS-X 10.5
</P>
<P>
To install, double-click the MupMate-71.dmg disk image
to get it mounted. You could then drag and drop the MupMate folder
to a convenient place on your hard disk.
The global folder /Applications or your personal folder ~/Applications
would be a good place. If you are upgrading, be careful
not to overwrite any files you might have stored
in the folders MupIncludes or MupMusic.
</P>
<H2>Contents of the folder MupMate</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>MupMate.app</I>
The double-clickable graphical user interface application for
using <i>Mup</i> without the Unix command line.
This application is self-contained.
It contains its own copy of the mup command line tool
and a copy of the <I>Mup</I> online documentation
(accessible in the &quot;Help&quot; menu).
<I>MupMate</I> is built on the cross-platform <B>FLTK</B> library.
It runs in the native Mac OS X graphical environment,
but does not look and behave like a real Mac OS X application;
see the section on
<A HREF="#issues">known issues</A> below.
<BR>
<i>MupMate</i> relies on an external viewer application
to display the generated Postscript files.
Similarly, an external application is needed to play back
generated MIDI files. The default configuration uses the Mac OS X command
/usr/bin/open for both tasks, which, in turn,
invokes the default applications for Postscript and MIDI files, respectively.
On a stock Mac OS X installation these are the <b>Preview</b> application
for Postscript files and the <b>QuickTime Player</b>
application for MIDI files. Use the &quot;Change All&quot; button in
the <B>Finder</B>'s &quot;Get Info&quot; dialog to choose different
default applications. Or you can enter different commands in the dialog
Config --&gt; File Locations&quot; of the <I>MupMate</I> application.
<LI>
<I>MupMusic</I>
This folder contains a couple of example text files
in <B>Mup</B> music input format. The <I>MupMate</I> application is
preconfigured to open files in this folder,
but you are free to store your <I>Mup</I> input files wherever you like.
<LI>
<I>MupIncludes</I>
This folder could be used to store <I>Mup</I> include files
intended for use in multiple songs.
The <I>MupMate</I> application is preconfigured to look into this folder,
if a file mentioned in a include statement cannot be found next
to the including song file.
</UL>
</P>
<H2>Installation of Command Line Tools</H2>
<P>
(This is an optional step. It is not required to use the MupMate application.)
If you want to invoke <I>Mup</I> directly from a Unix command line
(e.g. the Terminal application), you can copy the commands from the folder optional_CmdLineTools/bin to /usr/local/bin or some other folder
on your Unix command search path. The associated manual pages are available
in optional_CmdLineTools/man/man1.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="issues">Known Issues</A></H2>
<P>
<I>MupMate</I> is a cross-platform application based on the
<B>FLTK</B> library. It looks and behaves like <B>FLTK</B> applications
on Linux and Windows platforms, not like a true Mac OS X application.
For example, menus, keyboard shortcuts, and file dialogs are different.
</P>
<P>
If there are international characters in the path
to the <I>MupMate</I> application, there may be cosmetic glitches with
displaying and editing file paths in dialogs.
Despite their garbled appearance, the paths should still work correctly.
</p>
<P>
If the <b>Preview</b> application fails to convert and display
a generated Postscript file of typeset music,
only a generic error message is shown.
