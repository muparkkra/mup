<H1>Mup for blind users</H1>
<P>
Since Mup uses a simple text file as input rather than a GUI,
it can be used very successfully by people who are blind,
to produce professional-quality music output.
If you can edit a text file, you can create Mup input.

Additional features that make Mup more accessible for blind users than
most other music publication programs include:

<LI>
Mup can produce
<A HREF="uguide/midi.html">MIDI output,</A>
so you can &quot;proofread&quot; your input
by listening to it.
<LI>
Mup handles all the layout details automatically, so while you might sometimes
wish to briefly enlist the help of a sighted friend just to ensure the
final product looks as nearly &quot;perfect&quot; as possible,
in most cases, the output will be very acceptable without any extra fiddling.
<LI>
The
<A HREF="uguide/index.html">Mup User's Guide</A>
is available in HTML format, and since it is straightforward
HTML without lots of extraneous formatting tags,
almost any text-to-speech or text-to-Braille software should be able to
handle it easily.
<LI>
Unlike special custom software, which can be very expensive,
